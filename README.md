# PumpFun-Comment-Bot
Apart from a few OGs, most of these AI tokens are pure nonsense. Even the recent ones created with tools like Claude Computer Use are essentially human-generated. The instructions are usually as simple as 'go to www.pump.fun, enter the pre-made human-generated name in the Name field'—and that’s all bullshit!

That’s why we came up with our project. The code, token name, ticker, picture—everything was created by AI with minimal human intervention, unlike the earlier projects. We let the AI do what it does best.

What Makes This Different? We used OpenAI and Claude APIs to generate:

The project code The deployment script Token Metadata (Name, Symbol, Image) Even this README text! Instead of micromanaging the AI, we just gave it a loose prompt to create an animal-based memecoin that doesn’t copy any earlier projects, but is still designed to be a SERIOUS money printer. That's it! The AI took care of everything else.

This project truly embraces AI-driven development, unlike the human-driven processes you usually see. The result? Something fresh, unpredictable, and created by AI, with proof you can verify.

Proof of AI-Generated Content We have verifiable proof of this. Go to Actions Tab to check out the details of the generated process (yes, even the workflow script was generated using OpenAI).

This is the real GEM—no bullshit. Lock in and APE IN!

Key Features: AI-generated token name, ticker, and image. OpenAI and Claude used for metadata and workflow creation. Fully automated deployment with minimal human input. PumpKeypairGen to create a custom keypair ending in "pump". Verifiable AI-generated process via Github Actions.
